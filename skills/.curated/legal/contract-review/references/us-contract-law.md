# US Contract Law Principles

## Overview

US contract law is primarily governed by state law, with some federal statutes applying to specific areas (e.g., bankruptcy, intellectual property). Most states have adopted the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) for contracts involving the sale of goods.

## Essential Elements of a Valid Contract

For a contract to be legally enforceable in the US, it must have:

1. **Offer**: A clear proposal made by one party (offeror) to another (offeree)
2. **Acceptance**: Unqualified agreement to the terms of the offer
3. **Consideration**: Something of value exchanged between parties
4. **Mutual Intent**: Both parties intend to be legally bound
5. **Capacity**: Parties have legal ability to contract (age, mental competency)
6. **Legality**: Contract purpose must be legal

## Common Contract Types

### Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)
- Protects confidential information
- Can be mutual (both parties exchange confidential info) or one-way
- Typical duration: 2-5 years
- Should define what constitutes confidential information
- Must include exceptions (publicly available, independently developed)

### Master Service Agreement (MSA)
- Framework contract for ongoing services
- Governs overall relationship; individual projects via SOWs
- Key terms: scope, payment, IP ownership, warranties, liability
- Typical duration: 1-3 years with renewal options

### Employment Agreement
- Governs employer-employee relationship
- Must comply with federal and state employment laws
- Key terms: compensation, benefits, duties, termination
- May include non-compete, non-solicitation clauses (enforceability varies by state)

## Key Contractual Provisions

### Limitation of Liability
- Caps maximum damages one party can recover
- Typically excludes certain types of damages (e.g., indirect, consequential)
- May not be enforceable for gross negligence, willful misconduct, or certain statutory violations
- Common cap: amount paid under contract (e.g., 12 months of fees)

### Indemnification
- One party agrees to protect another from certain claims/losses
- Should be mutual when possible
- May include duty to defend (pay legal fees) and hold harmless
- Typically capped and excludes indemnifying party's own negligence

### Intellectual Property
- Clearly define ownership of pre-existing IP
- Specify ownership of work product created during engagement
- Grant necessary licenses for use
- Consider work-for-hire provisions

### Warranties and Disclaimers
- Express warranties: Specific promises about performance
- Implied warranties: Merchantability, fitness for purpose (can be disclaimed)
- Disclaimer format: ALL CAPS or conspicuous placement
- UCC governs for goods

### Termination
- Termination for cause: Material breach, bankruptcy, force majeure
- Termination for convenience: Either party can exit (with notice)
- Effects of termination: Return of property, payment for work completed, survival clauses
- Notice period: 30-90 days typical for convenience termination

### Force Majeure
- Excuses performance due to unforeseeable events beyond parties' control
- Must list specific events (e.g., natural disasters, war, pandemics)
- Does not typically include economic hardship or supplier failures
- Should specify notice requirements and mitigation obligations

### Governing Law and Venue
- Choice of law: Which state's law applies
- Forum selection: Where disputes will be resolved
- Arbitration: Alternative to litigation (faster, private, but limited appeal rights)
- Class action waiver: May be included but enforceability varies

## Red Flags in Contracts

🔴 **High Priority**
- Unlimited liability
- Unilateral termination without cause
- Perpetual terms without exit
- Broad indemnification without caps
- Exclusive rights without limits
- No limitation of liability
- Assignment without consent

🟡 **Medium Priority**
- Missing force majeure
- Short termination notice
- Ambiguous scope of work
- One-sided warranties
- No confidentiality protections
- Unclear payment terms

## State-Specific Considerations

### California
- Non-compete clauses generally unenforceable
- Strong employee protections
- CCPA privacy requirements

### New York
- Common choice for commercial contracts
- Well-developed case law
- Courts generally enforce contracts as written

### Delaware
- Popular for corporate governance
- Sophisticated business courts
- Flexible corporate law

### Texas
- Enforces non-compete with reasonable scope/duration
- At-will employment state
- Business-friendly environment

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Avoid vague terms like "reasonable," "best efforts," "prompt"
2. **Define Terms**: Include definitions section for key terms
3. **Include Examples**: When appropriate, provide examples in parentheticals
4. **Number Provisions**: Makes references and amendments easier
5. **Use Plain Language**: Avoid legalese when possible
6. **Consider Both Sides**: Think about both favorable and unfavorable scenarios
7. **Reference External Documents Carefully**: Incorporate by reference properly
8. **Update Regularly**: Laws change; review and update templates periodically

## Negotiation Tips

- Everything is negotiable (though some terms may be non-negotiable in practice)
- Focus on material business terms first
- Understand the other party's key concerns
- Be willing to compromise on less important points
- Document all agreed changes properly
- Consider industry standards and market terms
- Know your BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement)
- Get legal review before signing significant contracts
