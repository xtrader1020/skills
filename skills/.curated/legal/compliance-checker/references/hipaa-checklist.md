# HIPAA Compliance Checklist

## Overview

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is a US federal law that protects the privacy and security of health information.

**Key Components**:

- **Business Associates**: Vendors/contractors that handle PHI on behalf of covered entities

**Key Concepts**:
- **PHI (Protected Health Information)**: Individually identifiable health information
- **ePHI**: Electronic PHI
- **De-identification**: Removal of identifiers to prevent re-identification
- **Minimum Necessary**: Use/disclose only the minimum PHI needed

## Protected Health Information (PHI)

**PHI includes** any health information that can be linked to an individual:

**18 HIPAA Identifiers**:
1. Names
2. Geographic subdivisions smaller than state
3. Dates (except year) related to individual
