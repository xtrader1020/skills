# NDA Standard Terms and Best Practices

## Standard NDA Components

### 1. Parties
- **Disclosing Party**: Entity sharing confidential information
- **Receiving Party**: Entity receiving confidential information
- **Mutual NDA**: Both parties are disclosing and receiving

**Best Practice**: Use full legal names, including entity type and jurisdiction of organization.

### 2. Definition of Confidential Information

**Standard Language**:
> "Confidential Information" means any information, technical data, or know-how, including, but not limited to, that which relates to research, products, services, customers, markets, software, developments, inventions, processes, designs, drawings, engineering, marketing, or finances, disclosed by one party to the other.

**Key Elements**:
- Broad enough to cover what you need protected
- Specific enough to be enforceable
- Include how oral information becomes confidential (written confirmation within X days)
- Specify how information should be marked ("Confidential," "Proprietary")

**Common Mistake**: Defining confidential information as "all information shared" is too vague and may not be enforceable.

### 3. Standard Exceptions (Carve-Outs)

Information is NOT confidential if it:

1. **Public Domain**: Is or becomes publicly available through no breach of the NDA
2. **Prior Knowledge**: Was already known to the receiving party before disclosure (with written proof)
3. **Independent Development**: Is independently developed by receiving party without use of confidential information (with written proof)
4. **Third Party**: Is rightfully received from a third party without breach of confidentiality
5. **Legal Requirement**: Must be disclosed pursuant to law, regulation, or court order (with prompt notice and cooperation to limit disclosure)

**Best Practice**: Always include all five standard exceptions. Courts expect to see them, and their absence may indicate an unreasonable agreement.

### 4. Permitted Use

**Standard Language**:
> Receiving Party may use Confidential Information solely for [PURPOSE], and for no other purpose without Disclosing Party's prior written consent.

**Options for Purpose**:
- "Evaluating a potential business relationship"
- "Performing services under the Service Agreement dated [DATE]"
- "Exploring a joint development opportunity"
- "Conducting due diligence regarding a potential transaction"

**Best Practice**: Be specific about the permitted use. Avoid vague purposes like "business discussions."

### 5. Disclosure Restrictions

**Standard Elements**:
- May only disclose to employees/contractors with "need to know"
- Recipients must be bound by confidentiality obligations
- May not disclose to competitors
- Receiving party is liable for breaches by its representatives

**Best Practice for Vendors**: Explicitly state that vendors are responsible for their subcontractors and employees.

### 6. Standard of Care

**Options** (from strongest to weakest):

1. **Strict Standard**: "Reasonable care, but in no event less than the care used to protect its own confidential information"
2. **Common Standard**: "At least the same degree of care used to protect its own confidential information, but no less than reasonable care"
3. **Minimum Standard**: "Reasonable care"

**Best Practice**: Use option 2 as it's market standard and enforceable.

### 7. Term and Survival

**Typical Terms**:
- **Agreement Duration**: 1-3 years (how long parties can share information)
- **Confidentiality Obligation**: 2-5 years from date of disclosure (how long information stays confidential after sharing)
- **Trade Secrets**: Perpetual or "as long as it remains a trade secret"

**Examples**:
- Technology/Software: 3-5 years
- Business relationships: 2-3 years  
- M&A discussions: 1-2 years
- Employee NDAs: Perpetual for trade secrets, 2-5 years for other confidential info

**Best Practice**: Match the term to the nature of the information and relationship. Courts may refuse to enforce perpetual terms for information that loses value quickly.

### 8. Return/Destruction of Materials

**Standard Language**:
> Upon termination of this Agreement or upon Disclosing Party's request, Receiving Party shall promptly return or destroy all Confidential Information in its possession and, if requested, certify in writing that it has done so.

**Options**:
- Return only
- Destroy only  
- Return or destroy (receiving party's choice)
- Return or destroy (disclosing party's choice)

**Exception**: Usually permits retention of one copy for legal/compliance purposes, and information in automatic backup systems.

### 9. No License or Rights

**Standard Language**:
> This Agreement does not grant Receiving Party any license, interest, or rights in or to the Confidential Information except as expressly stated herein. All Confidential Information remains the sole property of Disclosing Party.

**Purpose**: Makes clear that receiving party gets no IP rights, no right to use after termination, and no implied licenses.

### 10. No Warranty

**Standard Language**:
> ALL CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.

**Purpose**: Disclosing party doesn't warrant accuracy or completeness of information shared.

### 11. Remedies

**Standard Elements**:
- Acknowledge that breach causes irreparable harm
- Monetary damages may be inadequate
- Disclosing party entitled to injunctive relief
- Injunctive relief is in addition to other remedies (not exclusive)

**Why Important**: Without this language, you may need to prove damages before getting an injunction, which can be difficult for confidential information.

### 12. No Obligation to Disclose

**Standard Language**:
> Nothing in this Agreement obligates either party to disclose any Confidential Information or to proceed with any business relationship.

**Purpose**: Makes clear that the NDA itself doesn't create a binding business relationship.

## Jurisdiction-Specific Considerations

### United States

**Federal Law**:
- **Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA)**: Federal trade secret protection
- Allows for ex parte seizure in extraordinary cases
- Whistleblower protection required in employment NDAs (see below)

**State Law**:
- Contract law varies by state
- Most states have adopted Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA)

**California Specific**:
- Non-compete clauses generally unenforceable (except in sale of business)
- Employee NDAs cannot prohibit discussing wages, hours, or working conditions
- Cannot restrict reporting suspected illegal activity
- Very employee-friendly; be careful with broad restrictions

**Employee NDAs - Required Notice**

Under the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, 18 U.S.C. § 1833(b), the following notice must be included in employee NDAs:

> "An individual shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any Federal or State trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that (A) is made (i) in confidence to a Federal, State, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (B) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal."

**Best Practice**: Include this statutory notice verbatim in all employee NDAs to comply with DTSA requirements.

### European Union

**GDPR Considerations**:
- If confidential information includes personal data, GDPR applies
- Must have lawful basis for processing (contract, legitimate interest, etc.)
- NDA cannot override data subject rights (access, erasure, portability)
- May need Data Processing Agreement if receiving party processes personal data on behalf of disclosing party
- Consider cross-border transfer restrictions

**Best Practice**: 
- Add clause: "To the extent Confidential Information includes personal data, Receiving Party shall comply with all applicable data protection laws"
- Consider whether a separate DPA is needed

**Duration**:
- Under GDPR, indefinite data retention may be problematic
- Justify retention period based on purpose
- Consider data minimization principles

### United Kingdom

**Post-Brexit**:
- UK GDPR applies (similar to EU GDPR)
- Data adequacy between UK and EU subject to change
- Contract law follows common law principles

**Reasonableness Test**:
- Restrictive covenants must be reasonable in:
  - Scope (what's protected)
  - Duration (how long)
  - Geography (where it applies)
- Must protect legitimate business interest
- Cannot be broader than necessary

**Best Practice**: Keep terms reasonable. UK courts will "blue pencil" (strike down) unreasonable restrictions.

### Canada

**Provincial Variation**:
- Contract law varies by province
- Quebec: Civil law system (different from common law)
- Most provinces: Common law

**Privacy Laws**:
- PIPEDA (federal) or provincial privacy laws apply
- Similar considerations to GDPR for personal data

**Best Practice**: Specify which province's law governs.

## Common Negotiation Points

### From Receiving Party Perspective

**Narrower Definition**:
- Request specific categories rather than broad language
- Exclude information in certain categories from confidentiality

**Shorter Term**:
- 2 years instead of 5 years
- Especially for information that becomes stale quickly

**Broader Exceptions**:
- Add exception for information in receiving party's possession (not just "prior knowledge")
- Clarify that public disclosure of any portion makes that portion non-confidential (not entire disclosure)

**Permitted Disclosures**:
- To investors, board members, advisors
- In connection with financing or acquisition discussions
- As required by regulatory filings

### From Disclosing Party Perspective

**Broader Definition**:
- Include "information that should reasonably be understood as confidential"
- Cover information disclosed before NDA is signed (add "including information disclosed in the past [X] days")

**Longer Term**:
- 5+ years for valuable trade secrets
- Perpetual for true trade secrets

**Stricter Standard of Care**:
- "Same care as most sensitive information" instead of "own confidential information"
- Specific security requirements (encryption, access controls)

**Return/Destruction**:
- Require destruction (not just return)
- Require written certification
- Require destruction of copies and derivatives

## Red Flags

**⚠️ For Receiving Party**:
- No exceptions clause
- Perpetual term for non-trade-secret information
- "All information" is confidential without marking requirement
- Liability for consequential damages
- No limitation on damages
- Automatic renewal without notice
- Very broad non-compete or non-solicit (in jurisdictions where enforceable)

**⚠️ For Disclosing Party**:
- Very short confidentiality term (< 2 years) for valuable information
- Exception for information in receiving party's possession (no proof required)
- Weak standard of care ("reasonable efforts" without minimum)
- Right to disclose to anyone with a "business need"
- No remedy for breach other than damages

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Use Standard Form**: Start with a well-established form rather than creating from scratch
2. **Tailor to Relationship**: Customize based on parties, purpose, and information sensitivity
3. **Be Mutual When Possible**: Balanced agreements are more likely to be enforced and create goodwill
4. **Include All Standard Exceptions**: Courts expect them; their absence looks unreasonable
5. **Match Term to Information**: Short-lived information = shorter term; trade secrets = longer
6. **Specify Governing Law**: Don't leave it ambiguous
7. **Consider Industry Standards**: Some industries have standard NDA terms
8. **Get Legal Review**: For significant relationships, have counsel review
9. **Keep Records**: Track what was disclosed and when
10. **Mark Documents**: Clearly mark confidential materials

## Industry-Specific Variations

- Longer terms common (research is long-term)

### M&A
- Short initial term (due diligence phase)
- Standstill provisions common
- Non-solicitation of employees
- Use restrictions if deal doesn't close
