# Legal Compliance Advisor

## Overview

Help digital law firms conduct comprehensive privacy and compliance assessments for clients. Provide structured guidance for CCPA/CPRA compliance audits, privacy policy reviews, data protection assessments, and regulatory requirement analysis.

## Quick Start

1. **Identify the compliance need**: Determine which regulation or assessment the client requires (CCPA/CPRA, privacy policy review, data protection audit)
2. **Load relevant reference**: Access the appropriate checklist or framework from `references/`
3. **Conduct assessment**: Walk through requirements systematically, documenting current compliance status
4. **Generate deliverables**: Create assessment reports, gap analysis, and remediation recommendations

## Core Capabilities

### 1. CCPA/CPRA Compliance Assessment

Conduct comprehensive compliance audits for California privacy laws.

**Workflow:**
1. Review the complete CCPA checklist in `references/ccpa-checklist.md`
2. Assess client's current state against each requirement category
3. Document compliance status for:

   - Privacy policy completeness
   - Consumer rights implementation (right to know, delete, opt-out, correct, limit)
   - Verification procedures
   - Contractual requirements
   - Data minimization practices
   - Training and recordkeeping
4. Identify gaps and non-compliant areas
5. Generate prioritized remediation plan with timelines

**Key Focus Areas:**

- Data inventory and mapping
- Service provider contracts
- Sensitive personal information handling

### 2. Privacy Policy Review and Drafting

2. Check against regulatory requirements:
   - Categories of personal information collected

   - Business purposes for collection
   - Third-party disclosures and sharing
   - Consumer rights descriptions
   - Contact information and request mechanisms
3. Identify missing or inadequate sections

### 4. Regulatory Requirement Mapping

Help clients understand which regulations apply to their business.

**Consider:**

- Customer/user locations
- Industry-specific regulations (HIPAA, GLBA, COPPA, etc.)
- Revenue thresholds and data volume
- Nature of data collected (sensitive, health, financial, children's data)

**Output:** Clear explanation of applicable regulations and compliance obligations

### 5. Compliance Documentation Support

- Be specific: provide actionable recommendations with exact implementation guidance

### For Client Communication
- Use clear, non-legalese language where possible
- Explain the "why" behind requirements
- Provide examples of compliant implementations
- Include timelines and resource estimates for remediation

### For Deliverables
- Structure reports with executive summary, detailed findings, and appendices
- Use checklists and tables for easy reference
